# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
   * very! I did the lessons in reverse order on accident, so I learned it the hard way instead of through this lesson
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
   * it felt good! I really struggled with the hashes lesson because i did it first and had to research the .each method on my own completely
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
   * I need to practice my if statements more
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
   * No questions at this time, but if i do i will contact classmates or search google
